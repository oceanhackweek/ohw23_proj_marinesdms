## Marine Species Distribution Model (SDM) Tutorial

## Overview
This tutorial was developed during [OceanHackWeek2023](https://oceanhackweek.org/) to provide a simple workflow to developing a marine Species Distribution Model (SDM) using `R` programming. 



## Background

Species Distribution Models are used to predict a species' geographic and environmental range, typically incorporating environmental data into the analysis.

## Goals
Many tutorials exist to run SDM models, however most readily available tutorials focus on terrestrial-based models. Our goal through this tutorial is to highlight a marine-based SDM tutorial.

## Datasets

**Biological Data**

Our dataset includes biological presence-only data of four species of sea turtles found in the Indian Ocean. The presence dataset includes four species of sea turtles:

- Loggerhead, *Caretta caretta*
- Green, *Chelonia mydas*
- Olive Ridley, *Lepidochelys olivacea*
- Hawksbill, *Eretmochelys imbricata*

However, for this tutorial example model, we will focus on Loggerhead sea turtles data from 2000 until 2023 sourced from the Ocean Biodiversity Information System (OBIS) via the `robis` package.


**Environmental Data**

This tutorial focuses on regions in the northern Indian Sea, specifically the western Arabian Sea, Persian Gulf, Gulf of Oman, Gulf of Aden and Red Sea. Environmental predictor variables were sourced via the `SMDpredictor` R package and includes:

## Workflow/Roadmap
This tutorial is based on the [notes by Ben Tupper (Biglow Lab, Maine)](https://github.com/BigelowLab/maxnet/wiki/stars), and highlights modeling presence-only data via `maxnet` R package.

**Tutorial roadmap**

1. Presence Data
   -- obtain sea turtle data via `robis` 
2. Absence Data
   -- obtain random occurances within our area of interest using `robis`
3. Environmental Data
   -- obtain environmental predictors of interest using `SDMpredictors`
4. Model
   -- run species distribution model and predict using `maxnet`
6. Data Visualizations
